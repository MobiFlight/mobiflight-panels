# Generic flight simulation panels

This is a simple landing gear panel that has "Korry" switches and a slot for a gear handle mechanism. This is still work in progress, but the panel files are provided as an example and inspiration.

## Finished panel

The buttons have a 3D-printed "cap" over a tactile pushbutton and two 3mm leds that light up the top and bottom sides based on data from the simulated aircraft landing gear position and battery switch state.
